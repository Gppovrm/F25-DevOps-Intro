# Lab 10 — Cloud Computing Fundamentals

## Tasks

### Task 1 — Artifact Registries Research (5 pts)

#### 1.1: Research Artifact Registries

1. **Explore Cloud Provider Documentation:**

   Research the official documentation and services for:
   - **AWS:** Identify AWS's primary artifact registry service
   - **GCP:** Identify GCP's primary artifact registry service
   - **Azure:** Identify Azure's primary artifact registry service

   <details>
   <summary>🔍 What to research</summary>

   For each artifact registry service, investigate:
   - Official service name
   - What types of artifacts it supports (container images, npm packages, Maven, etc.)
   - Key features (security scanning, geo-replication, access control, etc.)
   - Integration with other cloud services
   - Pricing model basics
   - Common use cases

   </details>

#### 1.2: Document Your Findings

In `labs/submission10.md`, document:
- Service name for each cloud provider
- Key features of each artifact registry
- Supported artifact types
- Integration capabilities
- Comparison table highlighting similarities and differences
- Analysis: Which registry service would you choose for a multi-cloud strategy and why?

### Task 2 — Serverless Computing Platform Research (5 pts)

#### 2.1: Research Serverless Computing Platforms

1. **Explore Serverless Offerings:**

   Research serverless computing services for:
   - **AWS:** Identify AWS's primary serverless compute service(s)
   - **GCP:** Identify GCP's primary serverless compute service(s)
   - **Azure:** Identify Azure's primary serverless compute service(s)

   <details>
   <summary>🔍 What to research</summary>

   For each serverless platform, investigate:
   - Official service name(s)
   - Supported programming languages/runtimes
   - Execution models (event-driven, HTTP-triggered, etc.)
   - Cold start performance characteristics
   - Integration with other cloud services
   - Pricing model (per invocation, per execution time, etc.)
   - Maximum execution duration limits
   - Common use cases and architectures

   </details>

#### 2.2: Document Your Findings

In `labs/submission10.md`, document:
- Service name(s) for each cloud provider
- Key features and capabilities
- Supported runtimes and languages
- Pricing comparison
- Performance characteristics
- Comparison table highlighting similarities and differences
- Analysis: Which serverless platform would you choose for a REST API backend and why?
- Reflection: What are the main advantages and disadvantages of serverless computing?
